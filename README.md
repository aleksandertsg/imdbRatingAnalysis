# Exercise 1

This project is not commercial and is not related to any business case

### Identifying your business goals - not relevant, because 
* Background 
* Business goals
* Business success criteria

### Assessing your situation - not relevant
* Inventory of resources
    * [IMDb  1000 movies data](https://www.kaggle.com/PromptCloudHQ/imdb-data/)
    * [The Academy Awards dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/theacademy/academy-awards)
    * [5000 movies dataset from IMDb](https://www.kaggle.com/tmdb/tmdb-movie-metadata)
    * [Python library to retrieve data from IMDb](https://imdbpy.sourceforge.io/)
* Requirements, assumptions, and constraints
* Risks and contingencies
* Terminology
    * Movie - movie in context
    * Person - actor, producer or any other type of person related to topic
    * Rating/Rank - the movie rating
    * Votes - number of people voted for movie
    * Genres - genres of movie

* Costs and benefits

## Defining your data-mining goals
### Data-mining goals
The purpose of this project is to analyse the data of IMDb and other sources and 
find different type of correlations between various features such as:

* Movie rating and chances to win an Oscar
* Combinations of actors and directors and rating in IMDB
* Popularity of movie genres during last years and ratings in IMDB
* predict IMDB ratings of upcoming movies based on genre, actor and director collaboration happend before.
  
###Data-mining success criteria
  Success criteria for this project can be predicting rating ranges for upcoming movies with high correctness.
  
  In perfect world, the results of this research would help new movie companies to choose right actors, directors and plots for making really good movies and pursue higher income. :)

At this moment it is hard to do some estimation of time we will consume solving different tasks of our project.  List of tasks are not finally certain as well,  but here are some parts of that cycle:

Gathering all necessary data together: we are using different sources of movies, trying to fill the gaps of each dataset, and make one overall dataset for each goal. 

Field research and data cleaning. We need to find any help from this field which will lead us in choosing right feature parameters for our goals. The amount of the work is hard to assess at this current moment.

Make different models for rating prediction goals and for the movie cast classification goals. Using cross validations we need check performance and correctness of our models. Probably in some cases models will be in need of tuning. 

Summing up results we have on different models we will choose the best model and use it for our initial goals.
